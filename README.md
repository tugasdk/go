# go

The Go sdk for the tuga semantic logic

The logs we print are not there just show a bunch of text, each log printed tells us a story about a event that occours in certain period of time.
Of of that the computer science try to do is to emulate the way things are structured and implement in out society. One example the software development itself which trys to emulate how build are constructed by first having the architecture design and use the arcchiteture as the base do build and implement the software. With that in mind, as we said early logs tells a history about a ocoured event, why no tell this history using models that others fields use to tell history about a event? That is way we create *tuga*, a semantic log  framework that will allow to write logs intuitivelly and sematically.
